# bg3-dialog-timeline-edits

These are the scripts I wrote to generate my dialog edit mods.

This mod for Gale's romanced dialog:
https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/10179
is generated by running this script:
python bg3-dialog-timeline-edits\aeries_gale_dekarios.py

Replace all the hardcoded paths in the scripts with your own (search for path with Y:\bg3\multitool\)
Feel free to fork this and build on it, or release your own mods, even ones that edit the same things as my mods.
You do not need to ask for permission, but please give Moxi a callout on your page!
